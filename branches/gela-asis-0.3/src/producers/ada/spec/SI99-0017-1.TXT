!subject Trait_Kind is unclear for access definitions

!summary

The description of Trait_Kinds is unclear for An_Access_Definition_Trait.

!question

Should the description of Trait_Kinds be updated to clarify the
meaning of an_access_definition_trait (Yes.)

!recommendation

(See summary.)

!wording

Replace the first two paragraphs of 3.9.5

with:

  Trait_Kinds provide a means of further classifying the syntactic structure 
  or "trait" of certain A_Declaration and A_Definition elements.
  Trait_Kinds are determined only by the presence (or absence) of certain
  syntactic constructs. The semantics of an element are not considered.

  The syntax of interest here are the reserved words "abstract", "aliased", 
  "limited", "private", "reverse", whereever they appear, and the reserved 
  word "access" when it qualifies a definition defining an anonymous type
  (an access_definition).
  Trait_Kinds enumerates all combinations useful in this classification.


Replace the comment following An_Ordinary_Trait with
   -- The declaration or definition does not have any of the following traits

Replace the comment following An_Access_Definition_Trait with
   -- The definition defines an anonymous access type
 
!discussion

This wording change was the result of a discussion on SI99-0002 at the Porto ARG meeting,
questioning the wording '... and "access" when it appears in an_access_definition'.
This change is to clarify that the intent is for the an_access_definition_trait
to apply to an access_definition, and not to an access_type_definition. 

Note that SI-22 recommends that this entire type become obsolescent, so we're
not adding any new kinds of entities to the supported traits.
